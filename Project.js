                <p>Our project is based on developing a web application for weather forecasting. Weather forecast
                    application works on real-time scenarios where the past and present weather reports are considered to
                    depict the future weather scenarios. The users will have their account linked to the application so that
                    the suggestions of notifications can be more personalized.</p>
